# LogsCalculator
This calculator takes all your logs and creates a simple statistic with them.

## Usage
The calculator asks you for your SteamID64 and your SteamID3, which can be obtained on sites like https://steamid.io/.
It will take quite a while to download all the logs from the logs.tf API. After it finished you will see a list with your statistics.
### Remarks 
Only the latest 1000 logs are useable.
